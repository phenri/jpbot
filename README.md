# lichess-cheat-bot
a cheat bot written in javascript for the popular lichess.org chess site: contact at jonaspetersoncasey@gmx.com

You can run this script from the console on firefox 
OR install some add-on that lets you run scripts like GREASEMONKEY for FIREFOX , think it's tampermonkey for Chrome

After you've installed the add-on for your browser
1)Download Script
2)Install

feel free to contact me for any info,questions etc.

The script is obfuscated for the time being, to avoid the lichess team fixing it.

update 1/6/16:
I got lots of mails about 
i)cheat detection
ii)deobfuscating the script
iii)supporting/updating it.

i)Use the bot as help and try not following the exact sequence of suggested moves
all the time, this make it practically impossible to detect you.
ii)I don't plan on showing the inner parts yet since I'm actively using this against GMs over at lichess,
and defeating them is just too much fun
iii)no plans to do so, this is a one time version, something I did on a Saturday morning, hey if the lichess team fixes it good for them, I wont be releasing any updates.
